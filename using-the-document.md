When mounting assistive technology:

The main document MAT-DOC is available as a Microsoft® Word Document which can be completed on your computer, or printed and filled in manually. Some fields in the document properties have been used so you will only need to enter the information once, and the relevant parts of the document will be completed automatically.
To open document properties, click the ‘File’ tab in Microsoft® Word, and click ‘Show All Properties’ towards the bottom right. This will reveal the ‘Subject’ and ‘Company’ properties which we use to store the client name or reference and your service name respectively.
